# The_Lexer

Project Description:
    The lexer is a program that has the main goal of imitating the Lexical Analysis stage of a compiler. Although this program does not involve all of the language and it only reads specific inputs, it does accurately assign the supported lexemes to its tokens. The library "regex" was used to facilitate the construction of the lexer. 
    It reads of the input of a file, in this case the "input_scode.txt" and outputs a table cointaining the tokens and its lexemes, in this case "output.txt". 

Lexer members:
    Gustavo Couto Vanin
    Naeem Khayat Albirkdar
    Sebastian Rivera
